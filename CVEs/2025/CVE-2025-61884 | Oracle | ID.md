| **Vulnerability** | **CVE-2025-61884** |
|------------------|--------------------|
| **Type** | Information Disclosure / Remote Access (CWE-22: Path Traversal / Improper Access Control) |
| **Description** | A vulnerability in the Runtime UI component of **Oracle Configurator** (within Oracle E-Business Suite) allows a **remote, unauthenticated attacker** to access sensitive Configurator data via crafted HTTP requests. Exploitation may expose critical configuration or business data. |
| **Affected Systems** | Oracle Configurator (Oracle E-Business Suite) **versions 12.2.3 through 12.2.14** |
| **Attack Vector** | **Network (HTTP)** — no authentication required |
| **Exploit Mechanism** | The Runtime UI improperly validates crafted HTTP requests, enabling attackers to access internal Configurator resources and retrieve sensitive information without authentication. |
| **Impact of the Bug** | **High confidentiality impact** — unauthorized disclosure of sensitive configuration data, business logic, or proprietary information. |
| **Detection Techniques** | • Monitor HTTP logs for abnormal requests targeting Configurator Runtime UI endpoints<br>• Review server logs for unauthenticated access attempts<br>• Scan for environments running affected Configurator versions<br>• Analyze network traffic for unexpected data retrieval behavior |
| **How to Detect if Exploited** | • Check logs for Runtime UI access from unknown or external IPs<br>• Look for unusual or large data responses from Configurator endpoints<br>• Review audit trails for unauthorized data access events<br>• Verify whether the Configurator component was externally exposed |
| **Mitigation Steps** | • Apply Oracle’s **October 2025 patch** addressing CVE-2025-61884<br>• Restrict network access to the Configurator Runtime UI (firewalls, segmentation)<br>• Disable unused E-Business Suite modules to reduce attack surface<br>• Continuously monitor and audit access to Configurator endpoints |
