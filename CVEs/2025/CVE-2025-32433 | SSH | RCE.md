| **Vulnerability**         | CVE-2025-32433 |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Type**                  | Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution |
| **Description**           | This vulnerability affect the SSH server implementation within the Erlang/OTP (Open Telecom Platform) library. This flaw allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to achieve remote code execution (RCE) on a vulnerable system. The vulnerability arises from improper handling of SSH protocol messages during the initial connection phase, before authentication takes place.|
| **Affected Systems**      | Systems depends on the built-in SSH Server for `Erlang/OTP` versions prior to `Erlang/OTP-27.3.3` for `OTP v27`,  `Erlang/OTP-26.2.5.11` for `OTP v26`, `Erlang/OTP-25.3.2.20` for `OTP v25` |
| **Attack Vector**         | Remote: Attackers exploit Erlang/OTP SSH Server to be able to bypass the authentication process and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the SSH daemon. |
| **Exploit Mechanics**     | Exploits the lack of proper validation for SSH message numbers intended for post-authentication, allowing the sending of crafted messages (e.g., `SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN`, `SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST`) before authentication. The vulnerable server incorrectly processes these pre-authentication messages, leading to arbitrary command execution. |
| **The Impact of the Bug** | - Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE): Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the target system without needing any valid credentials. |
| **Detection Techniques** |  **Log Analysis** <br> - No no artifacts regards the exploit itself, all the artifacts are related to the command executed <br><br> **Network Traffic Inspection** <br> - Analyze the incomming traffic to the SSH server; check any `SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN` or `SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST` before revciving any `SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS` message. <br><br> **Behavioral Detection** <br>  - The SSH server with a vulnarable version recieves `SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN` or `SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST` request before sending `SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_SUCCESS`. <br><br> |
| **Mitigation Steps**       | Update to OTP-27.3.3 (for OTP-27), OTP-26.2.5.11 (for OTP-26), or OTP-25.3.2.20 (for OTP-25). |
| **Workarounds**            |  Disabling the SSH server or to prevent access via firewall rules |
