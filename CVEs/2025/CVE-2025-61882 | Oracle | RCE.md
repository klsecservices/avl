| **Vulnerability** | **CVE-2025-61882** |
|------------------|--------------------|
| **Type** | Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) / CWE-284, CWE-74 |
| **Description** | A critical vulnerability in the **Oracle Concurrent Processing** component (BI Publisher Integration) of **Oracle E-Business Suite** allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via HTTP. Attackers can inject malicious XSLT payloads that are executed server-side, resulting in full system compromise without user interaction. |
| **Affected Systems** | Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) versions **12.2.3 through 12.2.14** |
| **Attack Vector** | **Remote Network (Unauthenticated)** via HTTP/HTTPS. Attackers target the `/OA_HTML/configurator/UiServlet` or `/OA_HTML/SyncServlet` endpoints. |
| **Exploit Mechanism** | The attacker chains multiple exploitation primitives: SSRF or authentication bypass to reach internal components, followed by **XSLT injection**. A common attack chain (used by Cl0p) involves uploading a malicious template—often with a name beginning in **TMP** or **DEF**—into the database and triggering it via a preview request, causing the server to execute embedded Java commands. |
| **Impact of the Bug** | **Critical (CVSS 9.8)** — complete loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Enables data theft (financial/HR records), deployment of ransomware (e.g., Cl0p), and lateral movement inside the network. |
| **Detection Techniques** | • Monitor web logs for suspicious POST requests to **UiServlet** or **SyncServlet** from unknown IPs<br>• Use Database Activity Monitoring (DAM) to detect insertions into `XDO_TEMPLATES_B` where `TEMPLATE_CODE` begins with **TMP** or **DEF** |
| **How to Detect if Exploited** | • Query `XDO_TEMPLATES_B` for suspicious templates created since July/August 2025<br>• Review EDR logs for Java processes executing shell commands (`cmd.exe`, `bash`) or reaching out to external IP addresses |
| **Mitigation Steps** | • Apply **Oracle Security Alert CVE-2025-61882 (Oct 4)** AND the follow-up patch for **CVE-2025-61884 (Oct 11)** immediately<br>• Block outbound Internet traffic from EBS servers to prevent command-and-control connections<br>• Restrict access to `/OA_HTML` paths to trusted internal networks only |
| **Workaround if Available** | Block access to **UiServlet** and **SyncServlet** at the WAF or load balancer (may impact functionality). Apply WAF rules to detect and block XSLT injection attempts. |
