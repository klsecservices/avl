| **Type**      | Arbitrary files read                                                                                                                                      |
| **Description** | CVE-2024-24919 is a vulnerability in Check Point's CloudGuard Network Security appliance that allows unauthorized actors to read arbitrary files due to improper path traversal protection. |
| **The Impact of the Bug** | Attackers can access sensitive files, including /etc/shadow, potentially compromising system security. This vulnerability is especially critical in systems using **username-password authentication**. |
| **How to detect if you have a vulnerable application to this attack vector?** | Check for systems running vulnerable versions of CloudGuard Network Security with username-password authentication enabled. |
| **Exploitation** | In-The-Wild Scripts for CVE-2024-24919 exploit a vulnerability in Check Point's CloudGuard by sending specially crafted HTTP POST requests to read arbitrary files on the target system. It uses a directory traversal attack in the payload 'aCSHELL/../../../../../../../{file_name}' sent to the URL https://{ip}/clients/MyCRL |
