| **Vulnerability**         | CVE-2025–55182<br>React2Shell<br> Duplicate CVE (CVE-2025-66478) |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Type**                  | Pre-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) |
| **Description**           | This vulnerability affects React Server Components (RSC) and frameworks that incorporate them (such as Next.js). It was publicly disclosed on December 3, 2025 <br> Affected Packages<br> - react-server-dom-parcel<br> - react-server-dom-turbopack<br> - react-server-dom-webpack|
| **Affected Systems**      | - React versions 19.0.0, 19.1.0, 19.1.1, 19.2.0<br>- Next.js: 15.0.5, 15.1.9, 15.2.6, 15.3.6, 15.4.8, 15.5.7, 16.0.7, 15.6.0-canary.58, 16.1.0-canary.12+ |
| **Attack Vector**         | Remote: <br> - Authenticated attacker can send one packet with a malicous code targeting the deserilization|
| **Exploit Mechanics**     | - The vulnerable code unsafely deserializes payloads from HTTP requests to Server Function endpoints.<br> - This deserialization flaw allows payloads to influence internal loading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the application server process.<br> - The exploit is pre-authentication, meaning threat actors don’t need valid credentials or prior access.<br> `{...,{"_response":{"_prefix":"process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('[Command]');",...}}}` |
| **The Impact of the Bug** | Remote code execution with the same perivilage for React process |
| **Detection Techniques** |**Network-Level IoCs**  <br>HTTP requests targeting RSC endpoints with unusual multipart/form-data or malformed RSC protocol payloads<br>High volumes of POST requests with abnormal content length/structure to React server endpoints<br> **Host / Process IoCs**<br>Unexpected child process creations spawning shell commands such as sh, bash, cmd.exe<br>     |
| **Mitigation Steps**       | **Apply Immediate Patches**<br>- Upgrade React Server Components to patched versions `react-server-dom-parcel`,`react-server-dom-webpack`,`react-server-dom-turbopack` → 19.0.1, 19.1.2, 19.2.1 or later.<br> -For Next.js builds incorporating RSC update to recently released patch versions (e.g., 15.0.5+, 16.0.7+)<br>**Web Application Firewall**<br> - Deploy WAF signatures that detect and block known exploit payloads|
