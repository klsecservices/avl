# Active Vulnerability List (AVL)

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to tracking **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs)** that may have been identified as potentially exploitable in the wild. 

Our mission is to emphasize the critical importance of patch management by demonstrating how a single unpatched vulnerability can severely impact an environment. By maintaining this list, we aim to provide actionable insights that help organizations and individuals proactively safeguard their systems from real-world threats.

## Why AVL Matters

Based on incident response statistics, we have observed that a significant percentage of security incidents stem from exploiting known vulnerabilities present in victim environments. These incidents often occur because of poor or delayed patch management policies. 

If vulnerabilities had been patched in a timely manner, many of these attacks could have been prevented. To address this, AVL was created to:

1. **Highlight the risks** associated with unpatched vulnerabilities.
2. **Provide up-to-date information** about actively exploited CVEs.
3. **Educate organizations and individuals** on the importance of robust patch management policies.

## Repository Contents

This repository includes:

- **Detailed CVE Listings**: information about CVEs maybe actively exploited in the wild.
- **Impact Analysis**: Insights on how these vulnerabilities can affect your systems.
- **Mitigation Guidelines**: Best practices for patching and securing your environment.
- **Incident Response Tips**: Suggestions for responding effectively to exploit attempts.

## How to Use This Repository
