| **Vulnerability**                     | **CVE-2025-22225** |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| **Type**    | Arbitrary Write / Write-What-Where Condition |
| **Description**              | CVE-2025-22225 is an arbitrary write vulnerability in VMware ESXi. A malicious actor with privileges within the VMX process may trigger an arbitrary kernel write, leading to a sandbox escape. This vulnerability allows attackers to write to arbitrary memory locations in the hypervisor kernel, potentially compromising the host system. |
| **Affected Systems**         | - VMware ESXi versions prior to 8.0 U3d (build 24585383)  <br> - VMware ESXi 7.0 versions prior to U3s (build 24585291)  <br> - VMware Cloud Foundation versions prior to 5.x (build 24585383)  <br> - VMware Telco Cloud Platform versions 5.x/4.x/3.x/2.x |
| **Attack Vector**            | Local access within the VMX process; requires an attacker to have administrative privileges on a virtual machine hosted on the vulnerable ESXi server. |
| **Exploit Mechanism**        | An attacker with administrative privileges on a guest VM can exploit this vulnerability to perform arbitrary writes to the hypervisor's kernel memory, leading to a sandbox escape and potential execution of code on the host system. |
| **Impact of the Bug**        | Successful exploitation can lead to: <br> - Escape from the virtual machine sandbox <br> - Execution of arbitrary code on the ESXi host <br> - Potential full compromise of the host system |
| **Detection Techniques**     | - Monitor for unusual activities originating from VMX processes. <br> - Analyze logs for signs of sandbox escapes or unauthorized kernel memory modifications. <br> - Monitor for changes to critical system files or configurations that could indicate unauthorized access.|
| **IOCs Related to Exploitation** | - Presence of unfamiliar or unauthorized processes on the ESXi host. <br> - Unusual network traffic patterns originating from the ESXi host. <br> - Modifications to system files or configurations without proper authorization. |
| **Mitigation Steps**         | - Apply the latest patches provided by VMware to address this vulnerability. <br> - Limit administrative access to virtual machines to trusted users only. <br> - Implement strict access controls and monitoring for VMX processes. <br> - Regularly audit systems for signs of compromise or unauthorized changes. |
| **Workaround (if available)** | No official workaround is available. Applying the security patches provided by VMware is the recommended course of action. |
