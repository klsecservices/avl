| **Description** | CVE-2024-32002 is a vulnerability in Git SCM affecting specific versions that allows attackers to exploit submodules to write files into the `.git/` directory using symbolic links and case-insensitive filesystems. |
| **The Impact of the Bug** | This vulnerability can lead to remote code execution (RCE) by executing a malicious **hook script** during a `git clone` operation, potentially compromising the system. |
| **How to detect if you have a vulnerable application to this attack vector?** | Check if your Git version is one of the affected versions (2.45.1 and others listed). **Assess the use of symbolic links and case-insensitive filesystems.** |
| **Exploitation** | The exploit involves setting up a malicious repository with a submodule containing a symbolic link to its `.git/` directory, where a hook script resides. <br><br> When cloned on a vulnerable system, the script is executed, potentially allowing for RCE. <br><br> Disable symbolic links with `git config --global core.symlinks false` could be used to prevent exploitation. <ul><li>**IN-THE-WILD** <ul><li>In-The-Wild exploits for this CVE set up a malicious Git repository that uses a submodule and symbolic links to create a scenario where cloning the repository triggers the execution of a malicious Git hook.</li><li>The script suggests running a `git clone --recursive` command on the repo, which includes the malicious setup. This cloning process executes the malicious hook, potentially allowing remote code execution.</li></ul></li></ul> |
