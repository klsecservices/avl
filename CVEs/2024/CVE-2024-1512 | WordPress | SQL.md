| **Vulnerability** | CVE-2024-1512 |
|-------------------|---------------|
| **Type**          | SQL Injection |
| **Description**   | CVE-2024-1512 pertains to a SQL Injection vulnerability in the MasterStudy LMS plugin for WordPress, impacting versions up to 3.2.5. This flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to append SQL queries to the 'user' parameter of the `/lms/stm-lms/order/items` REST route due to improper sanitization of user inputs. Successful exploitation can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data from the database. This critical vulnerability poses a substantial threat to WordPress sites leveraging the plugin and requires immediate updates and remediation to mitigate potential risks. |
| **The Impact of the Bug** | Attackers can perform unauthorized database operations, potentially extracting, altering, or deleting sensitive information. This impacts data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. |
| **How to detect infections** | - Use tools like sqlmap or the referenced Go script, which checks response delays with crafted SQL payloads to detect the vulnerability.<br> If the response time is significantly longer than usual, it suggests that the SQL injection attempt might have succeeded, indicating a potential vulnerability.<br> - Monitor HTTP requests to `/lms/stm-lms/order/items` endpoint with untrusted `user` parameter input.<br> - Log and alert on requests showing unusual response delays, indicating potential SQL injection attempts.<br> **Go Detector**<br> 1. Checks for SQL injection by sending crafted requests to the `/lms/stm-lms/order/items` REST route, using specific payloads that manipulate the `user` parameter.<br> 2. Analyzes response times to identify successful exploitation attempts, indicating potential SQL injection vulnerabilities based on delayed responses. |
| **Mitigation**    | To mitigate CVE-2024-1512, ensure you update the MasterStudy LMS WordPress Plugin to a version beyond 3.2.5, as this release contains a patch for the identified vulnerability. Additionally, it is crucial to rigorously validate and sanitize all input parameters to prevent potential SQL injection attacks and maintain the security and integrity of your system. |
