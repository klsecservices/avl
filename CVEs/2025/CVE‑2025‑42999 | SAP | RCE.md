## CVE‑2025‑42999

| **Vulnerability**                     | **CVE‑2025‑42999** |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **Type**                              | Insecure Deserialization (RCE) |
| **Description**                       | CVE‑2025‑42999 is a critical insecure deserialization vulnerability in SAP NetWeaver AS Java (Visual Composer). Malicious payloads uploaded by privileged users are deserialized unsafely, allowing code execution. Often chained with CVE‑2025‑31324 for post-patch persistence and deeper compromise. |
| **Affected Systems**                  | SAP NetWeaver AS Java 7.0–7.5 with Visual Composer enabled, prior to SAP Note 3604119. |
| **Attack Vector**                     | Requires authenticated access (Visual Composer role) or use of previously planted payloads; triggered via Visual Composer service. |
| **Exploit Mechanism**                 | Attacker uploads or triggers malicious serialized content; Visual Composer deserializes it and executes attacker code. |
| **Impact of the Bug**                 | Enables persistent RCE, allowing attackers or insiders to fully compromise SAP servers, escalate privileges, or maintain access even after CVE‑2025‑31324 is patched. |
| **Detection & IOCs**                  | - **Webshell/Backdoor Checks:** Same webshell patterns as CVE‑2025‑31324 (unexpected JSP/class files).<br>- **User Activity Monitoring:** Review Visual Composer user actions for odd uploads or triggers.<br>- **SAP Logs:** Watch for unusual deserialization errors or class loads.<br>- **Post-Exploitation Signals:** Outbound C2 traffic, or post-exploitation frameworks (e.g., Brute Ratel, Cobalt Strike) on SAP servers. |
| **Mitigation Steps**                  | - Apply SAP Security Note 3604119 (May 2025 cumulative patch).<br>- Disable Visual Composer if unused.<br>- Harden and monitor privileged SAP accounts.<br>- Conduct incident response if compromise suspected. |
| **Workaround (if available)**         | Disable or remove Visual Composer services until patched; restrict access to Visual Composer endpoints. |
